# Snakes and Ladders console based game 

Inspired by a codewars Kata.  

My first proper ruby program built completely on my own. 

## To run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sblausten/snakes-ladders.git
cd snakes-ladders/snakesladders
ruby SnakesLaddersMultiplayer.rb
```

## Bugs
End game doesn't display correct square when you roll over 100.
